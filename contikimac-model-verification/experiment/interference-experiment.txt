Run two experiments.

Experiment 1: Sample the RSSI on one Tmote Sky node while running the Garetto
interferer on anotbher node. After a while, start using net-test.c on two
other nodes, and measure the energy consumption and the PRR. Use channel 26.

Experiment 2: Sample the RSSI on one Tmote Sky node. After a while, start
using net-test.c on two other nodes, and measure the energy consumption and
the PRR. Use channel 22 or 23 to get some real WiFi interference.
